# multiplejoint_2

Unlike the existing method, I made the automatic mode and manual mode implemented respectively by pressing the numbers 1 and 2.

1.
When automatic mode is selected(when 1 is pressed), 
the red light on the robot arm comes on, and joints 1, 2, and 3 move automatically.
Prevent the robot arm from bending and set it to rotate only to a certain angle

2.
When passive mode is selected, the user can move joints 1, 2, and 3 by pressing a,b,c and p,q,r respectively.
Depending on the direction of the angle (based on the yaxis), a, b, and c are clockwise and pqr is counterclockwise.

3.
Finally, by pressing the right and left arrow keys, the entire robot is set to move.

With the above three things, the robot arm can do more free and efficient work.
